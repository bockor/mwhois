NAME
    nra-whoisd - Bruno's Naming & Registration's Simple whois service

FILE
    /home/bruno/tbc/mwhois/nra-whoisd.py

DESCRIPTION
    Source: git clone https://github.com/DaKnOb/mwhois.git
    Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3912
    Modified by: bruno.on.the.road@gmail.com
    
    Description: 
    nra-whoisd.py is a server software compatible with the whois command
    on most linux and unix systems.  It is  fully compliant with the
    RFC 3912. It can serve domain name and  IPv4  whois records when
    queried and uses a linux / unix filesystem structure for storing
    all the records. 
    
    Requirements:
    - Linux / Unix based operating system
    - Python 2.7
    - python netaddr module
    
    Usage:
    In order to use the server, simply run the whois command  in
    any operating system with the -h flag followed by your server's
    IP Address and then the  query.  An  example  asking  localhost
    about 10.0.0.0 is: whois -h 127.0.0.1 10.0.0.1.
    
    Storage Structure:
    The database that is served by whoisd is using the linux / unix
    filesystem in order to store content. There is a  folder  named
    "db" with two primary sub-folders, "ipv4" and "domains". In the
    first folder, all whois content for IPv4 Addresses is  located,
    and in the second folder, there is all the  whois  content  for 
    the domain names. All IPv4 records are stored  in  files  named
    after the IP Address  CIDR  Block.  For  example,  the  network
    10.0.0.0/8 is stored in a file named 10.0.0.0-8  that  contains
    all the information that will be served. All the new  lines  in
    this file must be represented by <CR><LF> in order to  maintain
    full compatibility with RFC 3912. As far as  domain  names  are 
    concerned, the storage is similar, where the name of  the  file 
    is the actual domain name.
    
    Protocol Example:
    If one places a request of the WHOIS server located at 
    whois.nic.mil for information about "Smith", the packets on the
    wire will look like:
    
    client                           server at whois.nic.mil
    
    open TCP   ---- (SYN) ------------------------------>
               <---- (SYN+ACK) -------------------------
    send query ---- "Smith<CR><LF>" -------------------->
    get answer <---- "Info about Smith<CR><LF>" ---------
               <---- "More info about Smith<CR><LF>" ----
    close      <---- (FIN) ------------------------------
               ----- (FIN) ----------------------------->

FUNCTIONS
    isDomain(qr)
        # Check if the input is a valid domain name
    
    isIP(qr)
        # Check if the input is a valid IPv4 Address
    
    isIPinCIDR(ip, network)
        # Check if an IP belongs to a CIDR IP block
    
    main()
        # Starts the whois daemon, validates query and responses
    
    sanitizeQuery(qr)
        #       Sanitize the query received
    
    strftime(...)
        strftime(format[, tuple]) -> string
        
        Convert a time tuple to a string according to a format specification.
        See the library reference manual for formatting codes. When the time tuple
        is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
